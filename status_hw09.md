Web Dev Spring 2021 HW09 Status

Answer the following questions:


1. What's your name?
Jaime Kvaternik


2. What's the URL of the github repo with your work for this HW?
https://github.com/jkvaternik/events-spa


3. What's the URL that you deployed to?
http://events-spa.jk-web.site/


4. Is your app functionality complete? If not, what's missing?
I wasn't able to figure out how to only show events for the user
currently logged in. To remedy this, I made it so that if a user
tries to access an event that they are not an owner of or invited
to, it will say to contact the owner of the event to be let in â€”
kind of like requests in Google Drive. Otherwise, I think I got
everything else done!

Also, much of this code is based on the lecture code for Photo Blog
SPA.


5. Is your app properly deployed? If not, what went wrong?
Yup! At first I didn't know what do to with the URL but luckily I
found an answer on StackOverflow that led me to the right solution.
Everything else went good!
